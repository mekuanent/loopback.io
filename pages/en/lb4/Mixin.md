## Mixin

TBD

- Should it be a separate concept or merge into decorator?

>  Interface for functions that can mix properties/methods into a base class

This makes the essence of a mixin function same as a class decorator.

> Apply one or more mixin functions

Could be equivalent to composited class decorators

A decorator also gives the benefit of supplying metadata.

- Introduce repositoryMixin
